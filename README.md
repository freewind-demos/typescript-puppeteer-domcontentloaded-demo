TypeScript Puppeteer DonContentLoaded Demo
==========================================

```
npm install -g puppeteer
```

Note: since puppteteer needs to download a very huge Chrome which makes the installation quite slow,
I prefer install puppteteer globally and link it to this project before running.

Run

```
npm run server
```

and

```
npm run demo
```

in two commond lines.
